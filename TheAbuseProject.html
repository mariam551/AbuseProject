<center> <h3> <font style="font-size:40px;" > What is Domestic Violence? </font> </h3> </center>
<center> <font style="font-size:20px;" > <p class="indent"> Domestic violence is the willful intimidation, physical assault,
  battery, sexual assault, and/or other <br>
  abusive behavior as part of a systematic pattern of power and control
  perpetrated by one intimate partner <br>
  against another. It includes physical violence, sexual violence, psychological
  violence, and emotional abuse. <br>
   The frequency and severity of domestic violence can vary dramatically;
   however, the one constant <br>
   component of domestic violence is one partner's consistent efforts to
   maintain power <br>
   and control over the other. </p> </font> </center>

<center> <font style="font-size:20px;" > <p class="indent"> Domestic violence is an epidemic affecting individuals
  in every community,regardless of<br>
 age, economic status, sexual orientation, gender, race, religion, or
nationality. It is often <br>
accompanied by emotionally abusive and controlling behavior that is only a
fraction of a systematic <br>
pattern of dominance and control. Domestic violence can result in physical injury,
psychological trauma, and in <br>
 severe cases, even death. The devastating physical, emotional, and psychological
 consequences of omestic<br>
 violence can cross generations and last a lifetime. This information was taken from <a href="http://ncadv.org/learn-more/what-is-domestic-violence"
